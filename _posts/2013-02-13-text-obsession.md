*My new found love of text, essays, and the composition process.*

##The Beginning

I recently started a new job at a company called [Faithology](http://faithology.com). Feel free to visit it now but know there is a huge revamp on the horizon. Joining Faithology was a practice in scratching a few itches I've been nursing for some years in many ways. I find the goal of creating a reliable, unbiased resource for religious information intriguing and surprisingly absent on the web today. Information about can be hard to gather when doing research in this particular field especially online. What excites me even more however is the process or how information is built and then relayed to its audience.

Faithology lives and dies by its content.

That likely isn't a shocking statement but I think it reveals just how crucial our tooling is. You see, more than one editor at a time is usally working on a particular article or document and they need to communicate edits or changes via the document. More than that they need a history of what changes have been made and even an avenue for general communication. They need all of this and they need it to publish to the web, directly.
