I can't believe I'm just finding this out but there is something called [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) which has **free** font glyphs. Font glyphs are rad because of two things. 

1. They scale very well for high density screens
2. Changing the color of them is as easy as ```style="color:#000000;"```

Github pioneered the icons as fonts area of web with their [Octicons](https://github.com/blog/1106-say-hello-to-octicons_) and I think it's spot on for most needs. The only limiting factor is each icon can only have one color.

Previously I was using the free [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com) for my social links but quickly saw how ugly they were on retina devices (they also have fonts, just not free). I've swapped them out for Font Awesome glyphs and I think they look much better.
