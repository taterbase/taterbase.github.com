title: Always Be Building, Even if You're Only Building Yourself
---

I think it's important for software developers to have a stone that they
continually polish, maybe 3 or 4. It's important to work on something for a long
period of time whether it's for months or years at a time. It's important
because to truly master and understand something you must develop a relationship
with it. You have to find each crevice, each bump, each scratch and smooth it
out. The act of polishing is intended to be something meaningful and present.
The very action should hold your full attention while produce something beautiful by
removing cruft and residue.

[Joel Spolsky wrote about *good software* taking 10 years] (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html) and I completely agree with him however I think the important aspect is not that good software took 10 years to come into existance, but that someone spent 10 years working on the product so that it could be considered *good*. I think for developers to master their craft they have to approach their software much like polishing a stone. I'm not talking about that
distributed image sharing service you built on Bitcoin's blockchain. That was
fun but will likely be forgotten and relegated to the dusty cellar of Github. I'm talking about projects like sqlite, vim, Linux! Projects
that have been worked on for years and years and continue to be useful
throughout time while also getting better. No it doesn't have hardly any
buzzwords in it nor does it make use of the latest and greatest zookeeper
replacement. But it's been doing what it's been doing for years and continues to
do so in a useful way. You should aim for your software to be similar to such
building blocks in that you find a nugget of usefulness and you polish it.

Sometimes you don't feel like working on software or sometimes you don't know
what to work on. I find easy fallbacks can be as simple as going for a run or
going to the gym. If you can't build software right now build your self.
Polishing a stone doesn't have to be relegated to a single activity or area.
Sometimes in order to polish a stone better you must better the tool doing the
polishing. You are as important and need as much building as your projects.
Learn to include yourself in the act of creating better things. Learn to treat
yourself as a century long project with laser like focus and intention as you
develop who you are and the abilities you have.
