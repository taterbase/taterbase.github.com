*Thoughts on the forthcoming data revolution*

##My Fear.

Let me start off by saying the two words **math** and **data** inspire a certain anxiety within myself. The roots of that discomfort are small but feel significant. I have never considered myself very savvy with higher level math. While I have always excelled at algebra I honestly lost the plot with Geometry. Calculus too, while compelling, continued to throw me for a loop. I find it difficult to map these to programming even though I know them to be closely related.

Data, or at least the concept of aggregated data, encourages that anxiety due to my perception that the only feasible way to make sense of data is with complex mathematical algorithms. Algorithms that I'm not quite ready to tackle. In my mind math goes hand in hand with data and that won't change any time soon. It's clear that if I wish to tackle the data problems I desire I will have to struggle and push for understanding in areas that leave me baffled. With that said let's embrace the fear, the uncertainty, and try to uncover why this is important.

##What is Data?

No, this is not an afterschool special and I'm sure most of you have very solid ideas of what data is but I want to dig into it a bit. For a moment consider the fact that data is all around you. Traffic is data. The number of cars in a given stretch of freeway. The amount of gas expended moving from point A to point B. The rate at which the cars are moving and even the average time of day traffic begins to collect. Your home is filled with data too. The temperature, amount of electricity used, and even the amount of times you get up to use the bathroom. It's all data. Everything you do, observe, and ignore. Little stats and numbers that float through every day life with what seems like small significance.

*And we've started measuring it.*

More than that we've started trying to make sense of it. The world is talking to us through numbers and statistics and we have begun to take notice, write it down, and build meaning out of that. You do this subconsciously. When you decide to leave work early or later to skip traffic you have assessed data. When you use the bathroom before bed so you don't get up in the middle of the night you have made a decision based on data. We are constantly working out next steps and ideas based purely on past experiences, data. The human brain is astonishing in its capacity to perform these calculations but it is not perfect. The brain is influenced by outside factors such as emotions and even chemical alterations. The brain is not perfect. But a computer can be.

##Computation as Truth.

Computers are more apt for objective analysis. In theory you could provide the same input repeatedly and receive identical output each and every time. That is pretty powerful if you think about it. A system that adheres to laws and rules so strict that for each *x* there can only be one *y*. Can you say that about humans? How many days have you felt glorious and upbeat only to feel down or depressed the next? Humans are vulnerable to side effects. Computers function in spite of side effects. Sure, software/hardware bugs are known to occur but for the most part these are reproducible and even solveable. A *y* for an *x*.

So we know computers are immune to the factors that prevent most humans from objective decision making. Where does that leave us? The computer is a fantastic tool capable of reliable results and side effect free information but the computer is only as powerful as it's master. Developers can teach computers to do miraculous things such as finding the [latest, largest prime number](http://www.mersenne.org/various/57885161.htm). Or [store terabytes of information in DNA](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134672-harvard-cracks-dna-storage-crams-700-terabytes-of-data-into-a-single-gram). We can even [simulate potential protein combinations](http://folding.stanford.edu/English/HomePage) in nature to search for potential cures to untreatable diseases. Developers can compile and produce the most useful and wonderful information the world has yet to see. But first, the developer must know how.

*I don't know how.*

I couldn't tell you where to start if you needed an algorithm to find patterns in bird migrations. I wouldn't know the first thing about simulating the slow shift of tectonic plates beneath the earth's crust. I would be useless in an endeavor to compute the effect on literacy by changing the availability of public libraries. I can't do these things. Yet.

##The Beginning of a Journey.

I believe the first step to solving a problem is recognizing what exactly is problematic. If I hope to be useful in a glorious future of problem solving based on our ever present data I need to prepare myself with the right knowledge and toolset. Getting started won't be easy but living in today's day and age I have more than enough tools available. [Kahn Academy](http://kahnacademy.org) and [Coursera](http://coursera.org) are two great examples of free quality venues to familiarize yourself with complex maths and even computer science. I'm not making any promises but I think writing this post is enough to show, at least to myself, that I'm ready for the next chapter. That I'm ready to set aside fear of the unkown or complex. That I'm ready to do more than build apps for browsers or phones.

**I'm ready.**
