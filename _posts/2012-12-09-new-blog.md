Well, I finally bit the bullet and put my old blog to rest. It was an old Rails knockoff of [Svbtle](http://svbtle.com) called [Obtvse](https://github.com/NateW/obtvse). The old blog was very boilerplate and I didn't really want to delve to deep into customization with it which led to me not wanting to post very often for fear I would migrate soon.

Well, that migration has happened.

Welcome to the new and improved [georgeshank.com](http://georgeshank.com). It's faster, stronger, and powered by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). For those that don't know Jekyll is a "blog aware" static site generator that just happens to be available on Github's free pages offering. With a little css, html, and some YAML configuring you're off with a free blog by Github. It's pretty powerful stuff.

Another fun part of creating the new blog is that this one makes use of ["responsive design"](http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/). Many people have different interpretations of what that means and for this blog that just means it looks good on all screens. (Except maybe retina macbooks, [let me know](http://twitter.com/taterbase) if not!)

I'm hoping that with a new blog I'll be encouraged to post more. Who knows, maybe I'll post less. Either way a new year is around the corner and I'm thinking some big changes are on their way.
